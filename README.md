## Introduction
Credit card approval prediction is a common problem in the financial industry. This project aims to build a predictive model to determine whether a credit card application will be approved or not based on the applicant's information.

## Installation
To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bgvikas/Credit-Card-prediction.git
cd Credit-Card-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Install the required dependencies as mentioned in the Installation section.
3. Run the data preprocessing script to clean and prepare the dataset.
4. Train the model using the training script.
5. Evaluate the model using the evaluation script.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about credit card applicants. The features include age, income, employment status, credit score, and other relevant information. The target variable is the approval status of the credit card application.

## Model
The model used for prediction is a machine learning classifier. Various algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting are experimented with to find the best-performing model.

## Evaluation
The model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation is also performed to ensure the robustness of the model.
